RUN C like nodemon with cpace:
cpace filename.c

OR:

COMPILE C CODE FILE, GENERATE a.out:
gcc filename.c

RUN a.out:
./a.out

CREATE EXECUTABLE FROM C FILE (WITHOUT a.out):
gcc filename.c -o filename

RUN filename:
./filename

YOU CAN RENAME a.out TO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

OR USE clang:

clang FILENAME.c 
clang -o FILENAME FILENAME.c
